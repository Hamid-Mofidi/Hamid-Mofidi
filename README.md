- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hamid-Mofidi, a postdoctoral fellow at the Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (BIMSA), associated with Yau Center at Tsinghua University. Before coming to China, I was a visiting assistant professor at the University of Iowa, USA, for two years, working with the Mathematical and Computational Biology group in the Mathematics Department. I got my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Kansas.
- 👀 As a Ph.D. holder in Applied Mathematics with a focus on dynamical systems and mathematical neuroscience models, I am passionate about utilizing deep learning and neural networks to study the dynamics of mathematical biological models. With my experience in numerical and computational tools, I am enthusiastic about the potential to make significant contributions to this exciting field. 
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in deep learning and neural networks, with the goal of leveraging these cutting-edge techniques to study the dynamics of mathematical biological models. With my strong foundation in mathematics and my growing expertise in computational modeling, I am confident in my ability to make significant contributions to this exciting field.
- 💞️ I am passionate about exploring new research directions and collaborating with other experts in the field to push the boundaries of what is possible.
